\title{Smoother weights from k-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm}
\usage{
\method{weights}{knn_fit}(arguments, x, xnew = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{arguments}{Output of \code{\link{knn_fit}}}

\item{x}{Covariate matrix of training sample}

\item{xnew}{Covariate matrix of test sample}

\item{...}{Ignore unused arguments}
}
\value{
Matrix of smoother weights.
}
\description{
Extract smoother weights for k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm.
This comes quite naturally here as the weight will be \code{1 / k} for all
'neighbors' and 0 for all 'non-neighbors' (for a given test set observation).
