nuisance_cf(
  method,
  Y,
  X,
  cf_mat,
  cv = 5,
  cv_mat = cv_mat,

\arguments{
\item{method}{List of methods to be used in \code{\link{ensemble}} estimation.
Methods can be created by \code{\link{create_method}}.}

\item{Y}{Vector of variable to be predicted.}

\item{X}{Matrix of covariates.}

\item{cf_mat}{Logical matrix with k columns of indicators representing the different folds
(for example created by \code{\link{prep_cf_mat}}).}

\item{cv}{Number of cross-validation folds when estimating ensemble model.
Default value is 1 which then evaluates to a short-stacking procedure which
is computationally less demanding than standard stacking.}

\item{cv_mat}{Optional list of logical matrices of indicators representing the different folds,
possibly from already estimated \code{NuisanceParameters} object.}

\item{subset}{Optional logical vector if only subset of data should be used for prediction.}

\item{storeModels}{Vector of characters indicating where to save individual 
models for future processing (default "No").}

\item{path}{Path to save fit_cv matrix and non-negative least square weights to.
Optionally, weights as well.}

\item{quiet}{If FALSE, progress output is printed into console.}

\item{pb}{A progress bar object to track overall computation progress.}

\item{pb_np}{String indicating the current nuisance parameter being
estimated/predicted (for progress bar updates).}
}
\value{
Returns a vector of length N containing nuisance parameters.
}
