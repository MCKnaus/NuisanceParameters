\title{Cross-fitting fold indicators}
\usage{
prep_cf_mat(n, cf, w_mat = NULL, cl = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of observations}

\item{cf}{Number of cross-fitting folds}

\item{w_mat}{Optional logical matrix of treatment indicators (n x T+1 with T
being the number of treatments).
For example created by \code{\link{prep_w_mat}}.
If specified, cross-fitting folds will preserve the treatment ratios from full sample.}

\item{cl}{Optional vector of cluster variable if cross-fitting should account for clusters}
}
\value{
Logical matrix of cross-fitting folds (n x # folds).
}
\description{
\code{\link{prep_cf_mat}} creates a matrix of binary cross-fitting fold
indicators (n x # cross-folds)
}
